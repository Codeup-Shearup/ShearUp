# ShearUp

An application that helps barbers build a portfolio of abilities, and where clients find barbers faster with the help of a visual dashboard. Aside from being a portfolio site for barbers and a job listing site of their own craft, ShearUp is a matchmaking service for the barbering industry.

## Motivation

During the COVID pandemic clients were having trouble connecting to Barbers. With state restrictions on gathering and businesses being non-operational for a time there needed to be a way to contact your local barber. 
This is when the idea for Shearup was created, by Knoah Cotto. Shearup aims to connect clients with a Barber in a post COVID world. This application is for Barbers to easily promote themselves, their services, and have clients contact them for their services.
